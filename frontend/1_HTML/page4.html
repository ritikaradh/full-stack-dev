        <p>The true meaning of Ritika cannot be described with just a few words. 
            Your name is your destiny, heart's desire, and personality. 
            Ritika is a name that signifies a freedom-loving and free-spirited individual. 
            Nothing is conventional with your love of change and adventure. 
            You make sensible decisions very quickly, especially in a dangerous or difficult situation. 
            You are inquisitive and often ask others “Why this?,” “Why that?,” or just plain “Why?.” 
            Multi-tasking is a breeze for you - eat and watch TV at the same time!
