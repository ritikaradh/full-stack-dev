                    -->     choosing different shades of the same color.
            -->     Impactful color combination- Complementary
                    -->     complementary colors are the colors which are just opposite of each other in the color wheel.
            -->     High contrast combination- Triadic
                    -->     triadic colors are the three colors which are equally seperated from each other in the color wheel.
