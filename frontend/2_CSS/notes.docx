CSS- Getting Started
    What is CSS?
        It is a language that is used to describe the style of a document.

    Basic Format of CSS:
        Syntax:
            h1{
                color:red;
            }

        How to include style?
            1.  Using Inline style

            2.  Using <style> tag:  
                    Style is added using the <style> in the same document.
                    e.g., <style>
                                h1{
                                    color:red;
                                }
                            </style>
                            
            3.  External Stylesheet:    
                    Writing CSS in a seperate document & linking it with HTML file.

            4.  Linking HTML with CSS file:
                    <head>
                        <link rel="stylesheet" ref="style.css">
                    </head>

            5.  Color Property:
                    Used to set the color of the foreground.
                    e.g., color:purple;
                        color:#ffffff;

            6.  Background color property:
                    Used to set the color of the background.
                    e.g., background-color:purple;
                        background-color:#ffffff

            7.  Color Systems:
                    i.      named system:       direclty using the name of the color.
                    ii.     rgb system:         red green blue, e.g., color=rgb(0,0,0); 
                                                can use google's color picker.  
                    iii.    Hexadecimal or Hex: e.g., color=#ffffff
                                                    letters: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F
                                                type of rgb format where ff-denote r, ff-denote g, ff-denote b.

            8.  Text Properties:    
                    i.      text-align: left, right, center, start, end, justify.

                    ii.     font-weight: ranges from 100-700, by default normal(400) and bold(700), bolder and lighter.

                    iii.    text-decoration:
                                sets the appearance of the decorative lines on text like underline.
                                e.g., text-decoration: underline
                                    text-decoration: overline
                                    text-decoration: line-through
                                for more such, search on mdn.

                                Usecase: used for removing underline from links on anchor tag.
                                            syntaax: a{
                                                text-decoration: none
                                            }

                    v.      letter-spacing: controls the horizontal spacing behavior between text characters.
                                            e.g., letter-spacing: normal
                                                letter-spacing: 10px
                    vi.     font-size:

CSS- Level 2
    1.  Selectors:
            Types:
                1.  Element Selectors: selects elements like h1, p, a etc.
                2.  Universal Selector: to select everything in a document, denoted using '*'.
                3.  Id-selector: selects an element based on the value of the element's id attribute, accessed using '#'.
                4.  Class-selector: selects an element based on their class attribute, accessed using '.'.
                5.  Descendent selector: selects all paragraphs inside divs.
                                            e.g., div p{
                                                property:value;
                                            }
                6.  Attribute selector: select elements based on the presence or value of a given attribute.
    
    2.  Combinators: used to combine multiple combinators.
            Types:
                1.  Adjacent sibling combinator: denoted using '+'.
                        e.g., heading3 that comes immediately after any paragraph.

                2.  Child combinator: denoted using '>'.
                        e.g., selects all buttons which are direct children of spans.

    3.  Pseudo Class:   A keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s).
            Types:
                1.  :hover          : moving the cursor to an element        
                2.  :active         : when an element is clicked, e.g., button.
                3.  :checked        : generally used for radio buttons or checkbox.
                4.  nth-of-type

            Syntax:
                element_name:pseudo_class_type

    4.  Pseudo Elements:    A keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected part of the selected element(s).
            Types:
                1.  ::first-letter      : used to apply effects on the first letter of the html element under consideration.
                2.  ::first-line        : used to apply effects on the first line of the html element under consideration.
                3.  ::selection         : used to apply effects on the selected area of the html element under consideration.

    5.  CSS- Cascading StyleSheets:
            1.  Cascade in CSS?
                    The CSS cascade algorithm's job is to select CSS decorations in order to determine the correct values for CSS properties.
                        e.g., h2{
                            background-color: yellow;
                        }

                        h2{
                            background-color: blue;
                        }
                    
                    Applicable to single document as well as multiple documents.

                    In case of multiple documents, the css file which included in the last of the html file is considerable.

            2.  Selector specificity:
                    Specificity is an algorithm that calculates the weight that is applied to a given CSS declaration.

                    Priority rule:
                        id > class > element

                    Better: use more selectors to specifiy an element, then there are higher chances of changing the element.

                    Mathematically, specificity is a three digit number.
                        _____      _____       _____
                        id      class,          element
                                attribute       &
                                & pseudo        pseudo-
                                -class          element

                    Shown by VScode itself in that

                    Note:   If specificity same, then check cascading.

            3.  Inline Specificity:
                    Inline style are more specific than id.

                    Note:   Inline styles are the ones that are mentioned in the html file itself.

            4.  !important:
                    To show the most specific thing in document.

                    e.g., h2{
                        background-color: blue !important;
                    }

    6.  Inheritance in CSS:
            1.  Input elements and buttons, by-default doesn't inherit properties.

            2.  For input elements and button to inherit properties, we need to write :
                    input{
                        background-color: inherit;
                    }
                    button{
                        background-color: inherit;
                    }

            3.  Every property by-default doesn't get inherited.
                    e.g., width, height, border.

            4.  Important:
                    While selecting colors for designing webpages, we can use the followings:
                        1. coolors for color pallets.
                        2. canva for color pallets.
                        3. colorspace for color pallets.
