Z Index:

    It decides the stack of elements.

    Overlapping elements with a larger z-index cover those with a smaller one.

    --> We cannot set the z-index of an element whose position is static or by-default.

    Syntax:
        i.      z-index: auto(0)        by default
        ii.     z-index: 1 / 2 /...     positive-> more -> lifts to up
        iii.    z-index: -1 / -2 / ...  negative -> less -> lifts to bottom
