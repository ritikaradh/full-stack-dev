FLEXBOX


1.      What is Flexbox?
            Flexible Box Layout.

            It is a one-dimensional layout method for arranging items in rows and columns.

            Flexbox helps in manipulating webpages to be responsive i.e., changing layout of webpage according to various screen size.

            1.1     The Flex Model:
                        Assigning flexbox properties to an html element.

            1.2     Flexbox Direction:
                        It sets how flex items are placed in the flex container, along with axis and direction.

                        i.      flexbox-direction: row;     main axis, left to right.
                        ii.     flexbox-direction: row-reverse;      main axis, right to left.
                        iii.    flexbox-direction: column;      main axis, top to bottom
                        iv.     flexbox-direction: column-reverse       main axis, bottom to top.

            1.3     Justify Content:
                        Tells how the browser distributes space between and around content items along the main-axis.

                        i.      justify-content: flex-start;
                        ii.     justify-content: flex-end;
                        iii.    justify-content: center;
                        iv.     justify-content: space-between;
                        v.      justify-content: space-around;
                        vi.     justify-content: space-evenly;
            
            1.4     Flex-Wrap:
                        Sets whether flex items are forced onto one line or can wrap onto multiple lines.

                        i.      flex-wrap:  nowrap;     (decreasing the width of the elements in a container to fit within same line.)
                        ii.     flex-wrap:  wrap;
                        iii.    flex-wrap:  wrap-reverse;

            1.5     Align Items:
                        Distributes our items along the cross axis.

                        i.      justify-content: flex-start;
                        ii.     justify-content: flex-end;
                        iii.    justify-content: center;
                        iv.     justify-content: baseline;      (text-aligned.)

            1.6     Align Content:
                        It sets the distribution of space between and around content items along a flexbox's cross-axis.

                        i.      align-content:  flex-start / flex-end / center
                        ii.     align-content:  space-between / space-around / evenly
                        iii.    align-content:  baseline;

            1.7     Align Self:
                        Align an item along the cross axis.

                        i.      align-self: flex-start;
                        ii.     align-self: flex-end;
                        iii.    align-self: center;
                        iv.     align-self: baseline;

                        Note:   Align-self is always in higher property as compared to align content.
