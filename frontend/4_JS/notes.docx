Javascript Programming Language Notes

CHAPTER 1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.      Data Types in JS:
            ->  Primitive Types:
                    i.      Number
                    ii.     Boolean
                    iii.    String
                    iv.     Undefined
                    v.      Null
                    vi.     Bignit (less frequently used)
                    vii.    Symbol (less frequently used)

            ->  typeof a:   returns datatype of the variable.

            i.      Numbers:
                    ->      Positive (14) and Negative (-4)
                    ->      Integers (45, -50)
                    ->      Floating numbers- with decimal (4.6, -8.9)

2.      Operations in JS:
            ->  Modulo (remainder operator)
            ->  Exponentiation (power operator)

3.      NaN in JS:
            ->  The NaN global property is a value representing Not-A-Number.
                e.g.,   0/0, NaN-1, NaN*1, NaN + NaN

4.      Operator Precedence:
            ->  This is the general order of solving an expression.
                (), **, * , / , % , + , -

5.      'let' keyword:
            ->  Syntax of declaring variables.
            ->  Used only once while declaring the variable.
            ->  The value of the variables declared as 'let' can be changed later. 
                e.g., let age = 23;
                      age = age + 1;

                      let cgpa;
                      cgpa = 8.9

                      let num1 = 1;
                      let num2 = 2;
                      let sum = num1 + num2;

6.      'const' keyword:
            ->  Values of constants can't be changed with re-assignment & they can't be re-declared.
            ->  The value of the variables declared as 'const' can not be changed later.
                e.g., const year= 2025;
                      const pi= 3.14;
                      year= 2026; //Error
                      year= year + 1; //Error
                      const g= 9.8;
